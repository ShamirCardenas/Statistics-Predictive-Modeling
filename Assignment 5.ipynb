    "**(a)** The lasso relative to least squares: iii. Less flexible and hence will give improved prediction accuracy when its increase in bias is less than its decrease in variance.\n",
    "Justification: Lasso adds an L1 penalty that constrains coefficients (some to exactly zero), making it less flexible than ordinary least squares. This constraint increases bias but reduces variance by preventing overfitting. Lasso improves prediction when the bias-variance tradeoff favors the variance reduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "**(b)** Ridge regression relative to least squares: iii. Less flexible and hence will give improved prediction accuracy when its increase in bias is less than its decrease in variance.\n",
    "Justification: Ridge regression adds an L2 penalty that shrinks coefficients toward zero (but not exactly zero), making it less flexible than least squares. Like lasso, it trades increased bias for decreased variance, improving prediction when variance reduction outweighs the bias increase.\n",
    "\n",
    "**(c)** Non-linear methods relative to least squares: ii. More flexible and hence will give improved prediction accuracy when its increase in variance is less than its decrease in bias.\n",
    "Justification: Non-linear methods (like polynomial regression, splines, or kernel methods) can capture complex relationships that linear least squares cannot, making them more flexible. They reduce bias by better fitting the true underlying function but increase variance. They improve prediction when the bias reduction is greater than the variance increase."

    "Based on our results, all five methods achieve virtually identical prediction accuracy with test errors of 0.0115, indicating we can predict college applications very accurately. The error range of 0.0000 shows no meaningful difference between approaches, suggesting the underlying relationship is strongly linear and all features are informative (as evidenced by Lasso retaining all 17 coefficients). While PLS was slightly more efficient by achieving the same accuracy with only 4 components compared to PCR's 17, the similar performance across all methods indicates you could use the simplest approach (linear regression) since more complex regularization and dimensionality reduction techniques provide no additional predictive benefit for this dataset."
